# Enhancing-PL-SLAM-for-Context-Aware-Mapping
PL-SLAM extends ORB-SLAM for real-time monocular visual SLAM by combining point and line features. It enhances robustness in low-texture environments, improves accuracy, and introduces a novel map initialization using line correspondences across frames.
